UI Journal Filtered - a Razor Enhanced Python Script for Ultima Online

a minimal journal gump focused on locally spoken and quest events
filters command words , colorized speakers and events persistent

using multiple filters to reduce to player and npc spoken words without "command words"
names are colorized consistently by deterministic seed to visually separate
only "Quest" and "Event" related system messages are whitelisted 

global chat may be displayed as well , tho is turned off by default
many settings are toggleable for preference 

filters =
common command words "bank" , "All guard me" , housing
repeating messages
known npcs are filtered out

events =
events are colorized and condensed into a single line 
harvest and kill global quests , virtue shrine corruption , danger zone rotation  

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- if "import" errors , download iron python 3.4.2 and copy the files in its "Lib" folder into your RazorEnhanced "Lib" folder 

---
Modified by Eremite for the Excelsior Shard - uoex.net 
 - Still needs lots of filtering work.
